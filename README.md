### Fast results

Flutter is fast. It's powered by hardware-accelerated 2D graphics
libraries like [Skia] (which underpins Chrome and Android) and
[Impeller]. We architected Flutter to
support glitch-free, jank-free graphics at the native speed of your device.

Flutter code is powered by the world-class [Dart programming language], which enables
compilation to 32-bit and 64-bit ARM machine code for iOS and Android,
JavaScript and WebAssembly for the web, as well as Intel x64 and ARM
for desktop devices.
